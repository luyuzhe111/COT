# Charaterizing Out-of-distribution Error via Optimal Transport

This repository is the official implementation of our NeurIPS 2023 paper [Charaterizing Out-of-distribution Error via Optimal Transport](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dz5X8hnfJc). A shorted version, [Predicting Out-of-Distribution Error with Confidence Optimal Transport](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dNGxmwRpFyG), was published earlier in ICLR 2023 Workshop. 


```run_estimation.py``` contains implementation of COT/COTT and baselines we compare against.
